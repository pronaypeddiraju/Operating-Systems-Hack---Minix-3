# Operating-Systems-Hack---Minix-3
Minix HaXX

This project was part of a Hackathon event wherein I had to work with a team to optimize the functioning of the Minix operating system.
The optimizations including modification to some key functionality of the OS including its memory management system.

Please note that this building this OS and running it on a machine may cause stability issues leading to system crahes depending on the hardware used.
